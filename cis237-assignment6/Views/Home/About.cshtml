    BeverageDB is a web application using ASP.NET MVC to manage a beverage database. Its main function is to list beverages in a remote
    database and allow a logged-in user to perform functions on the beverages the database contains. These functions are:
</p>
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Create - create a new item. There are five required fields: id, name, pack size, price, and active status.
    </li>
    <li>
        Edit - edit an existing item. Use this option to alter the above fields for the selected beverage.
    </li>
    <li>
        Delete - Delete an existing item. This will permanently and irrevocably remove the item from the database.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>In addition to these functions, a user may filter the displayed list by name, pack size, pack minimum price, and pack maximum price.</p>
